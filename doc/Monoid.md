# Monoids


A category with one single object (see below image) is called monoid. A monoid is a category with only one single object and many identity arrows. By definition those arrows are composable, since each pair of arrows satisfy that one arrow start at the end of the other because you only have one single element!

In Set theory a monoid is defined as a Set of elements with a binary operator that is associative and has an identity element.

Both monoids from category theory and set theory are equivalent.
